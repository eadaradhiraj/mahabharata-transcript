जनमेजयः पारिक्षितः सह भ्रातृभिः कुरुक्षेत्रे दीर्घसत्रमुपास्ते। तस्य भ्रातरस्त्रयः श्रुतसेन । उग्रसेनो भीमसेन इति। तेषु तत्सत्रमुपासीनेष्वागच्छत्सारमेयः ॥ १॥
Sauti said:
The son of Parikshit, Janamejaya, with his brothers, was attending his long sacrifice in the field of Kurukshetra. His brothers were three, namely-Shrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena. When they were sitting at the sacrifice, there came the son of Sarama.

जनमेजयस्य भ्रातृभिरभिहतो रोरूयमाणो मातुः समीपमुपागच्छत्॥ २॥
He, being beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya, went to his mother weeping.

तं माता रोरूयमाणमुवाच 'किं रोदिषि, केनास्यभिहत' इति ॥ ३॥
His mother, seeing him weep, asked him, "Why are you weeping, who has beaten you?"

स एवमुक्तो मातरं प्रत्युवाच- 'जनमेजयस्य भ्रातृभिरभिहतोऽस्मि' इति ॥४॥
Being thus questioned, he replied to his mother, "I have been beaten by the brothers of Janamejaya."

तं माता प्रत्युवाच- 'व्यक्तं त्वया तत्रापराद्धम्, येनास्यभिहतः' इति ॥ ५ ॥
And then his mother said, "You must have committed some fault, for which you have been beaten."

स तां पुनरुवाच 'नापराध्यामि, किंचिन्नावेक्षे, हवींषि नावलिह' इति ॥ ६॥
He replied, "I committed no fault. I did not lick the sacrificial ghee, I did not cast even a look at it."

तच्छत्वा तस्य माता सरमा पुत्रदुःखार्ता तत्सत्रमुपागच्छत्, यत्र स जनमेजयः सह भ्रातृभिर्दीर्घसत्रमुपास्ते ।। ७॥
Hearing this her mother, being very sorry for the affliction of his son, went to the place where Janamejaya with his brothers were attending his long sacrifice.

स तया क्रुद्धया तत्रोक्त 'अयं मे पुत्रो न किंचिदपराध्यति, नावेक्षते, हवींषि, नावलेढि, किमर्थमभिहतः' इति ॥ ८ ॥
She angrily addressed Janamejaya thus, "My son did not commit any fault. He did not lick your sacrificial ghee, he did not even look at it. Why did you then beat him?"

न किंचिदुक्तवन्तस्ते सा तानुवाच 'यस्मादयमभिहतो ऽनपकारी, तस्माददृष्टं त्वां भयमागमिष्यति' इति ॥ ९॥
They did not (condescend) to reply to her. On this she said, "As you beat my son who did not commit any fault, so will evil come to you when you least expect it."

जनमेजय एवमुक्तो देवशुन्या सरमया भृशं संभ्रान्तो विषण्णश्चासीत् ॥ १०॥
Janamejaya, having been thus cursed by the celestial bitch, Sarama, was very much alarmed and dejected.

स तस्मिन्सत्रे समाप्ते हास्तिनपुरं प्रत्येत्य पुरोहितमनुरूपमन्विष्यमाणः परं यत्नमकरोद्यो मे पापकृत्यां शमयेदिति ॥ ११॥
After finishing the sacrifice, he returned to Hastinapur and took great pains to find out a priest who could neutralise the effect of the curse by procuring absolution from his sin.

स कदाचिन्मृगयां गतः पारिक्षितो जनमेजयः कस्मिश्चित्स्वविषय आश्रममपश्यत्॥ १२॥
Janamejaya, the son of Parikshit, when out in hunting, saw in one part of his dominion a holy hermitage.

तत्र कश्चिद्ऋषिरासाञ्चक्रे श्रुतश्रवा नाम। तस्य तपस्यभिरतः पुत्र आस्ते सोमश्रवा नाम ॥ १३॥
Where lived a Rishi, named Srutashrava; he had a son who was named Somashrava, who was deeply engaged in austere penances.

तस्य तं पुत्रमभिगम्य जनमेजयः पारिक्षितः पौरोहित्याय वने ॥ १४॥
Being desirous to make the son of the Rishi his priest, Janamejaya,

स नमस्कृत्य तमृषिमुवाच- 'भगवन्न्यं तव पुत्रो मम पुरोहितोऽस्तु' इति ॥ १५॥
Saluted him and said, "O Bhagvan, allow your son to be my priest."

स एवमुक्तः प्रत्युवाच जनमेजयम् 'भो जनमेजय, पुत्रोऽयं मम सर्त्यां जातो महातपस्वी स्वाध्यायसंपन्नो मत्तपोवीर्यसंभृतो मच्छुक्रं पीतवत्यास्तस्याः कुक्षौ जातः ॥ १६ ॥
Being thus addressed by Janamejaya, the Rishi replied, "O Janamejaya, my son is accomplished in the study of the Vedas, endued with my full asceticism and deep in devotion, but he is born in the womb of a serpent who swallowed my vital fluid.

समर्थोऽयं भवतः सर्वाः पापकृत्याः शमयितुमन्तरेण महादेवकृत्याम्॥ १७॥
"He is able to absolve you from all sins except those committed against Mahadeva.

अस्य त्वेकमुपांशुव्रतं यदेनं कश्चिद् ब्राह्मणः कंचिदर्थमभियाचेत्तं तस्मै दद्यादयम् यद्येतदुत्सहसे ततो नयस्वैनम्' इति ॥ १८॥
But he observes a particular rule, namely he grants to a Brahmana whatever he asks from him. If you can allow him to do it, you can then take him."

तेनैवमुक्तो जनमेजयस्तं प्रत्युवाच - 'भगवंस्तत् तथा भविष्यति' ॥ १९ ॥
Janamejaya thus addressed by the Rishi, said "It shall be as you say."

स तं पुरोहितमुपादायोपावृत्तो भ्रातृनुवाच- 'मयाऽयं वृत उपाध्याय यदयं ब्रूयात्तत् कार्यमविचारयद्भिर्भवद्भिः' इति। तेनैवमुक्ता भ्रातरस्तस्य तथा चक्रुः स तथा भ्रातृन् संदिश्य तक्षशिलां प्रत्यभिप्रतस्थे तं च देशं वशे स्थापयामास ।। २०॥
He then took him as his priest and returned to his capital. He then addressed his brothers thus, I have chosen this person as my priest. Whatever he will command to do must be obeyed by you without questioning." The brothers did as they were requested. Giving these instructions to his brothers he marched against Takshashila and conquered that country.

एतस्मिन्नन्तरे कश्चिद् ऋषिर्धोम्यो नामायोदः । तस्य शिष्यास्त्रयो बभूवुः ॥ २ १॥
About this time there was also a Rishi, named Ayoda-Dhaumya. He had three disciples namely Upamanyu, Aruni and Veda.

उपमन्युरारुणिर्वेदश्चेति स एकं शिष्यमारुणि पाञ्चाल्यं प्रेषयामास 'गच्छ, केदारखण्डं बधान' इति ।। २२॥
One day the Rishi asked one of these three disciples, Aruni of Panchala, to go and stop a breach in the water-course in his field.

स उपाध्यायेन संदिष्ट आरुणिः पाञ्चाल्यस्तत्र गत्वा तम्, केदारखण्डं बहुं नाशकत्। स क्लिश्यमानोऽपश्यदुपायम् भवत्वेवं करिष्यामि ॥ २३॥
Thus ordered by the preceptor, Aruni of Panchala went to the spot, but could not stop the breach. He was very sorry that he could not

स तत्र संविवेश केदारखण्डे । शयाने च तथा तस्मिस्तदुदकं तस्थौ ॥ २४॥
carry out his preceptor's bidding, but at last he saw a means and he said, "I shall do it in this way." He entered into the breach and there laid himself down and thus the water was stopped.

ततः कदाचिदुपाध्याय आपोदो धौम्यः शिष्यानपृच्छत् 'क्व आरुणिः पाञ्चाल्यो गतः' इति ॥ २५॥
Sometime after, the preceptor Ayuda-Dhaumya enquired of his other disciples where Aruni of Panchala went.

ते तं प्रत्यूचुः 'भगवंस्त्वयैव प्रेषितः' गच्छ केदारखण्डं बधान इति। स एवमुक्तस्तान् शिष्यान् प्रत्युवाच - 'तस्मात्तत्र सर्वे गच्छामो यत्र स गतः' इति ॥ २६॥
Having been thus addressed, they replied, "Sir, he has been sent by you to stop the breach of the water-course in the field." Dhaumya, thus reminded, said to his pupils, "Let us all go to the place where he is."

स तत्र गत्वा तस्याह्वानाय शब्दं चकार- 'भो आरुणे, पाञ्चाल्य, क्वासि वत्स, एहि, इति ॥ २७॥
Having gone there, he cried, "O Aruni of Panchala, where are you? Come here, my child."

स तच्छत्वा आरुणिरुपाध्यायवाक्यं तस्मात् केदारखण्डात् सहसोत्थाय तमुपाध्यायमुपतस्थे ।॥ २८॥
Having heard the voice of his preceptor, Aruni rose speedily from the breach and stood before him.

प्रोवाच चैनम् 'अयमस्मि, अत्र केदारखण्डे निःसरमाणमुदकमवारणीयं संरोद्धं संविष्टः, भगवच्छब्दं श्रुत्वैव, सहसा विदार्य केदारखण्डम्, भवन्तमुपस्थितः । तदभिवादये भगवन्तम्, आज्ञापयतु भवान् कमर्थं करवाणि इति ॥ २९-३०॥
Addressing his preceptor Aruni said. "I was in the breach of the water-course. Having been unable to stop it by and other means, I entered myself into the breach to prevent the water from running out. It is only when I heard your honour's voice that I have left it and allowed the waters to escape. I salute you, great teacher, tell me what I am to do now.

स एवमुक्त उपाध्यायः प्रत्युवाच 'यस्माद्भवान् केदारखण्डं विदार्योत्थितः, तस्मादुद्दालक एव नाम्ना भवान् भविष्यति इत्युपाध्यायेनानुगृहीतः ॥ ३ १॥
The preceptor, thus addressed, said, "As you have opened the water-course in getting from the ditch, you shall be henceforth known as Uddalaka as a mark of your action" and blessed him.

'यस्माच्च त्वया मद्वचनमनुष्ठितम्, तस्माच्छ्रेयो ऽवाप्स्यसि। सर्वे च ते वेदाः प्रतिभास्यन्ति, सर्वाणि च धर्मशास्त्राणि' इति ॥ ३२॥
And as you have obeyed my command, you shall obtain good fortune. All the Vedas will shine in you and so will all the Dharma Shastras."

स एवमुक्त उपाध्यायेनेष्टं देशं जगाम । अथापरः शिष्योऽस्यैवापोदस्य धौम्यस्योपमन्युर्नाम ॥ ३३॥
Being thus blessed by his preceptor, Aruni went away to the country where his heart longed to go. The name of another Ayuda-Dhaumya's disciples was Upamanyu.

तं चोपाध्यायः प्रेषयामास - 'वत्सोपमन्यो ! गा रक्षस्व' इति ॥ ३४॥
Him the preceptor thus addressed, "Go my child, look after my kine.

स उपाध्यायवचनादरक्षद्‌गाः। स चाहनि गा रक्षित्वा दिवसक्षये गुरुगृहमागम्योपाध्यायस्याग्रतः स्थित्वा नमश्चक्रे ॥ ३५॥
As ordered by his preceptor, he went to look after the cows. Having tended them all day, he came back to the preceptor's house in the evening. He then stood before him and respectfully saluted him.

तमुपाध्यायः पीवानमपश्यदुवाच चैनं 'वत्सोपमन्यो केन ! वृत्तिं कल्पयसि, पीवानसि दृढम् इति ॥ ३६॥
His preceptor, seeing him in the best of health, asked, "Upamanyu, my child, by what means you support yourself? You are exceedingly plump?"

स उपाध्यायं प्रत्युवाच - 'भो भैक्ष्येण वृत्तिं कल्पयामि' इति ॥ ३७॥
He answered to his preceptor, "I support myself by begging."

तमुपाध्यायः प्रत्युवाच - 'मय्यनिवेद्य भैक्ष्यं नोपयोक्तव्यम्' इति। स तथेत्युक्तो भैक्ष्यं चरित्वोपाध्यायाय न्यवेदयत्।। ३८॥
The preceptor said, "You should not appropriate what you receive by begging without offering it to me." Being thus told he went away and offered all that he got by begging to his preceptor;

स तस्मादुपाध्यायः सर्वमेव भैक्ष्यमगृह्णात्। स तथेत्युक्तः पुनररक्षद्गाः। अहनि रक्षित्वा निशामुखे गुरुकुलमागम्य गुरोरग्रतः स्थित्वा नमश्चक्रे ॥ ३९॥
And the preceptor took from him all that he got. He, being thus treated, went away to look after the cattle. And after having tended them all day he came back in the evening. He stood before his preceptor and respectfully saluted him.

तमुपाध्यायस्तथापि पीवानमेव दृष्ट्वोवाच - 'वत्सोपमन्यो ! सर्वमशेषतस्ते भैक्ष्यं गृह्णामि। केनेदानीं वृत्तिं कल्पयसि' इति ॥४०॥
The preceptor, seeing him still as plump as before, said, "Upamanyu, my child. I take from you all that you get by begging. How do you contrive to support yourself now?"

स एवमुक्त उपाध्यायं प्रत्युवाच - 'भगवते निवेद्य पूर्वमपरं चरामि। तेन वृत्तिं कल्पयामि' इति ॥४१॥
Being thus questioned, he answered to his preceptor, "Sir, after giving you all I get by begging, I go again to beg to support myself."

तमुपाध्यायः प्रत्युवाच 'नैषा न्याय्या गुरुवृत्तिः अन्येषामपि भैक्ष्योपजीविनां वृत्त्युपरोधं करोषि, इत्येवं वर्तमानो लुब्धोऽसि' इति ॥४२॥
The preceptor, said "This is not the way you should obey your preceptor. You diminish the support of others who live by begging. Having thus supported yourself you have showed that you are coveteous.

स तथेत्त्युक्त्त्वा गा अरक्षत्। रक्षित्वा च पुनरुपाध्याय गृहमागम्योपाध्यायस्याग्रतः स्थित्वा नमश्चक्रे ॥ ४३॥
Having assented to all his preceptor's words, he went away (again) to tend the kine Having done it, he stood before the preceptor and respectfully saluted him.

तमुपाध्यायस्तथापि पीवानमेव दृष्ट्वा पुनरुवाच - 'वत्सोपमन्यो ! अहं ते सर्वं भैक्ष्यं गृह्णामि न चान्यच्चरसि । पीवानसि भृशम् केन वृत्तिं कल्पयसि' इति ॥ ४४॥
The preceptor saw that he was still plump and said, "Upamanyu, my child, I take from you all that you get by begging. You do not also go out begging for the second time. How do you now manage to support yourself?"

स एवमुक्तस्तमुपाध्यायं प्रत्युवाच - 'भो एतासां गवां पयसा वृत्ति कल्पयामि' इति। तमुवाचोपाध्यायः 'नैतन्याय्यं पय उपयोक्तुम्। भवतो मया नाभ्यनुज्ञात' इति ॥४५॥
Upamanyu, thus questioned, replied, "Sir, I now support myself with the milk of these cows." Hearing which the preceptor said, "It is not proper for you to drink the milk, since you were not addressed by me."

स तथेति प्रतिज्ञाय गा रक्षित्वा पुनरुपाध्यायगृहमेत्य गुरोरग्रतः स्थित्वा नमश्चक्रे ॥ ४६॥
He assented to his preceptor's words and went to tend the cattle. Having done it he stood before his preceptor and respectfully saluted him.

तमुपाध्यायः पीवानमेव दृष्ट्वोवाच 'वत्सोपमन्यो भैक्ष्यं नाश्नासि, न चान्यच्चरसि, पयो न पीबसि, पीवानसि भृशम् केनेदानीं वृत्तिं कल्पयसि' इति ॥४७॥
The preceptor saw that he was still fat and he asked, "Upamanyu my child, you do not support yourself by alms, nor do you go begging for the second time, nor do you drink the milk of my cows, but you are still fat, how do you support yourself now?"

स एवमुक्त उपाध्यायं प्रत्युवाच 'भोः फेनं पिबामि यमिमे वत्सा मातृणां स्तनात्पिबन्त उद्गिरन्ति॥४८॥
Thus questioned he said, "I now drink the froth that the calves throw out when they suck their mother's teats."

तमुपाध्यायः प्रत्युवाच 'एते त्वदनुकम्पया गुणवन्तो वत्साः प्रभूततरं फेनमुद्गिरन्ति । तदेषामपि वत्सानां वृत्त्युपरोधं करोष्येवं वर्तमानः। फेनमपि भवान्न पातुमर्हति' इति। स तथेति प्रतिश्रुत्य पुनररक्षद्गाः ॥४९॥
The preceptor replied, "The good calves, out of kindness towards you, throw out a large quantity of froth. You should not stand in the way of their full meal. Know, it is not proper for you to drink the froth." Upamanyu assented to this and went to tend the cattle.

तथा प्रतिषिद्धो भैक्ष्यं नाश्नाति न चान्यच्चरति पयो न पिबति। फेनं नोपयुङ्के स कदा चिदरण्ये क्षुधार्तोऽर्कपत्राण्यभक्षयत्।॥५०॥
Thus prevented by his preceptor (from supporting himself,) he did not feed on alms, he did not drink the milk, or taste the froth, he had thus nothing to eat. One day being very much oppressed by hunger he ate the leaves of Arka tree in a forest.

स तैरर्कपत्रैर्भक्षितैः क्षारतिक्तकटुरूक्षैस्तीक्ष्ण-विपाकैश्चक्षुष्युपहतोऽन्धो बभूव । ततः सोऽन्धोऽपि चङ्गम्यमाणः कूपे पपात ॥५१॥
His eyes were affected by the pungent, acrimonious, crude and saline qualities of the leaves and he became blind. When he was thus walking about feeling his way he fell into a deep well.

अथ तस्मिन्ननागच्छति, सूर्ये चास्ताचलावलम्बिनि उपाध्यायः शिष्यानवोचत्- 'नायात्युपमन्युः।' ते ऊचु 'वनं गतो गा रक्षितुम्' इति।। ५२॥
As he did not return that day to the Rishi's house when the sun was sinking down behind the summit of the western mountain, the preceptor said to his pupils that Upamanyu had not yet returned. And they replied that he had gone to the forest to tend the cattle.

तानाह उपाध्यायः - 'मयोपमन्युः सर्वतः प्रतिषिद्धः स नियतं कुपितस्ततो नागच्छति चिरं ततोऽन्वेष्यः' इत्येवमुक्त्वा शिष्यैः सार्धमरण्यं गत्वा तस्याह्वानाय शब्दं चकार- 'भो उपमन्यो ! क्वासि वत्स ! एहि' इति ॥५३॥
On this the preceptor said, Upamanyu is displeased, because he has been prevented from the use of everything. He is therefore, making late to come home. Let us go and find him out." Having said this, he went with his pupils into the forest and called aloud. "Ho, Upamanyu, where are you? My child, come here."

स उपाध्यायवचनं श्रुत्वा प्रत्युवाचोच्चैः- 'अयमस्मिन् कूपे पतितोऽहम्' इति। तमुपाध्यायः प्रत्युवाच- 'कथं त्वमस्मिन् कूपे पतितः' इति ॥५४॥
Having heard the voice of his preceptor he replied, "I have fallen into this well." The preceptor asked, "How have you fallen into this well?"

On this the preceptor replied, "Worship the twin Ashvinis, the physicians of the celestials and they will restore you your sight." Thus addressed, Upamanyu began to worship the twin Ashvinis by reciting the following words from the Rigveda.

sanskrit_text:

You have existed before the creation, O you first-born beings; you are manifest in this wonderful universe of five elements. You are infinite, you are the course of nature and intelligent Soul that pervades all. I desire to obtain you by the knowledge, derived from hearing and meditation. You are birds of beautiful feathers, that roost on the body which is likened to a tree. You are free from the three common attributes of all souls. You are beyond all comparison. You pervade the universe through its spirit in every created thing.

You have established with the cloth thus woven two courses of action; one regarding the Devas and the other regarding the Pitris.
